# Monitor

## Usage

`snyk monitor [<OPTIONS>]`

## Description

The `snyk monitor` command creates a project in your Snyk account to be continuously monitored for open source vulnerabilities and license issues. After running this command, log in to the Snyk website and view your projects to see the monitor.

For Snyk Container see [`snyk container` help](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/container)

For Snyk Infrastructure as Code follow the instructions in "Regularly testing IaC files" on [Snyk CLI for Infrastructure as Code](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/snyk-cli-for-infrastructure-as-code)

## Exit codes

Possible exit codes and their meaning:

**0**: success, snapshot created\
**2**: failure, try to re-run command\
**3**: failure, no supported projects detected

## Configure the Snyk CLI

You can use environment variables to configure the Snyk CLI and and set variables for connecting with the Snyk API. See [Configure the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-cli/configure-the-snyk-cli)

## Debug

Use the `-d` option to output the debug logs.

## Options

See also subsequent sections for options for specific build environments, package managers, languages and `[<CONTEXT-SPECIFIC OPTIONS>]` which you specify last.

### `--all-projects`

Auto-detect all projects in the working directory (including Yarn workspaces).

For more information see the article [Does the Snyk CLI support monorepos or multiple manifest files?](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360000910577-Does-the-Snyk-CLI-support-monorepos-or-multiple-manifest-files-)

### `--detection-depth=<DEPTH>`

Use with `--all-projects` or `--yarn-workspaces` to indicate how many subdirectories to search. `DEPTH` must be a number, `1` or greater; zero (0) is the current directory.

Default: 4, the current working directory (0) and 4 subdirectories.

Example: `--detection-depth=3` limits search to the specified directory (or the current directory if no `<PATH>` is specified) plus three levels of subdirectories; zero (0) is the current directory.

### `--exclude=<NAME>[,<NAME>]...>`

Can be used with `--all-projects` and `--yarn-workspaces` to indicate directory names and file names to exclude. Must be comma separated.

Example: `$ snyk test --all-projects --exclude=dir1,file2`

This will exclude any directories and files named "dir1" and "file2" when scanning for project manifest files. Such as: "./dir1", "./src/dir1", "./file2", "./src/file2", and so on.

### `--prune-repeated-subdependencies`, `-p`

Prune dependency trees, removing duplicate sub-dependencies.

Continues to find all vulnerabilities, but may not find all of the vulnerable paths.

### `--print-deps`

Print the dependency tree before sending it for analysis.

### `--remote-repo-url=<URL>`

Set or override the remote URL for the repository that you would like to monitor.

### `--dev`

Include development-only dependencies. Applicable only for some package managers, for example, `devDependencies` in npm or `:development` dependencies in Gemfile.

Default: scan only production dependencies.

### `--org=<ORG_ID>`

Specify the `<ORG_ID>` to run Snyk commands tied to a specific organization. The `<ORG_ID>` influences some features availability and private test limits.

If you have multiple organizations, you can set a default from the CLI using:

`$ snyk config set org=<ORG_`ID`>`

Set a default to ensure all newly monitored projects are created under your default organization. If you need to override the default, use the `--org=<ORG_ID>` option.

Default: `<ORG_ID>` that is the current preferred organization in your [Account settings](https://app.snyk.io/account)

For more information see the article [How to select the organization to use in the CLI](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360000920738-How-to-select-the-organization-to-use-in-the-CLI)

### `--file=<FILE>`

Specify a package file.

When testing locally or monitoring a project, you can specify the file that Snyk should inspect for package information. When the file is not specified, Snyk tries to detect the appropriate file for your project.

### `--package-manager=<PACKAGE_MANAGER_NAME>`

Specify the name of the package manager when the filename specified with the `--file=<FILE>` option is not standard. This allows Snyk to find the file.

Example: `$ snyk monitor --file=req.txt --package-manager=pip`

### `--unmanaged`

For C++ only, scan all files for known open source dependencies.

For options you can use with `--unmanaged` see [Options for scanning using `--unmanaged`](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/monitor#options-for-scanning-using-unmanaged)\`\`

For more information see [Snyk for C/C++](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-open-source/language-and-package-manager-support/snyk-for-c-c++)\`\`

### `--ignore-policy`

Ignore all set policies, the current policy in the `.snyk` file, org level ignores, and the project policy on snyk.io.

### `--trust-policies`

Apply and use ignore rules from the Snyk policies your dependencies; otherwise ignore rules in the dependencies are only shown as a suggestion.

### `--project-name=<PROJECT_NAME>`

Specify a custom Snyk project name.

Example: `$ snyk monitor --project-name=my-project`

### `--target-reference=<TARGET_REFERENCE>`

Specify a reference which differentiates this project, for example, a branch name or version. Projects having the same reference can be grouped based on that reference. Supported for Snyk Open Source and use with `--unmanaged`.

For more information see [Separating projects by branch or version](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/secure-your-projects-in-the-long-term/grouping-projects-by-branch-or-version)

Set the project business criticality project attribute to one or more values (comma-separated). To clear the project business criticality set `--project-business-criticality=`

Allowed values: `critical, high, medium, low`

For more information see [Project attributes](https://docs.snyk.io/getting-started/introduction-to-snyk-projects/view-project-information/project-attributes)

### `--project-tags=<TAG>[,<TAG>]...>`

Set the project tags to one or more values (comma-separated key value pairs with an "=" separator), for example, `--project-tags=department=finance,team=alpha` To clear the project tags set `--project-tags=`

### `--tags=<TAG>[,<TAG>]...>`

This is an alias for `--project-tags`

## Option for Maven projects

Default: true

## Options for Yarn projects

`--json`

`--remote-repo-url=<URL>`

`--target-reference=<TARGET_REFERENCE>`

There are also special options.

Usage: `--max-depth=1`&#x20;

Use 0 to disable archive extraction completely.

### `--print-dep-paths`

Display dependencies.

Use use this option to see what files contributed to each dependency identified.

To see how confident Snyk is about the identified dependency and its version, use the `--print-deps` or `--print-dep-paths` option.

For more information on uses of CLI options for C/C++ projects see [Snyk for C / C++](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-open-source/language-and-package-manager-support/snyk-for-c-c++)

### `--project-name=c-project`

Use with the `snyk monitor --unmanaged` command to override the default name Snyk gives your snapshots by entering the desired name.

## Options for build tools

### `-- [<CONTEXT-SPECIFIC_OPTIONS>]`

The format is `snyk <command> -- [<context-specific_options>]`

Example: `snyk monitor -- --build-cache`
