# Test

## Usage

`snyk test [<OPTIONS>]`

## Description

The `snyk test` command checks projects for open source vulnerabilities and license issues. The test command tries to auto-detect supported manifest files with dependencies and test those.

## Exit codes

Possible exit codes and their meaning:

**0**: success, no vulnerabilities found\
**1**: action_needed, vulnerabilities found\
**2**: failure, try to re-run command\
**3**: failure, no supported projects detected

## Configure the Snyk CLI

You can use environment variables to configure the Snyk CLI and set variables for connecting with the Snyk API. See [Configure the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-cli/configure-the-snyk-cli)

## Debug

Use the `-d` option to output the debug logs.

## Options

See also subsequent sections for options for specific build environments, package managers, languages, and `[<CONTEXT-SPECIFIC OPTIONS>]` which you specify last.

### `--all-projects`

Auto-detect all projects in the working directory (including Yarn workspaces).

For more information see the article [Does the Snyk CLI support monorepos or multiple manifest files?](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360000910577-Does-the-Snyk-CLI-support-monorepos-or-multiple-manifest-files-)

### `--detection-depth=<DEPTH>`

Use with `--all-projects` or `--yarn-workspaces` to indicate how many subdirectories to search. `DEPTH` must be a number, 1 or greater; zero (0) is the current directory.

Default: 4 , the current working directory (0) and 4 subdirectories.

Example: `--detection-depth=3` limits search to the specified directory (or the current directory if no `<PATH>` is specified) plus three levels of subdirectories; zero (0) is the current directory.

### `--exclude=<NAME>[,<NAME>]...>`

Can be used with `--all-projects` and `--yarn-workspaces` to indicate directory names and file names to exclude. Must be comma separated.

Example: `$ snyk test --all-projects --exclude=dir1,file2`

This will exclude any directories and files named "dir1" and "file2" when scanning for project manifest files. Such as: "./dir1", "./src/dir1", "./file2", "./src/file2", and so on.

### `--prune-repeated-subdependencies`, `-p`

Prune dependency trees, removing duplicate sub-dependencies.

Continues to find all vulnerabilities, but may not find all of the vulnerable paths.

### `--print-deps`

Print the dependency tree before sending it for analysis.

### `--remote-repo-url=<URL>`

Set or override the remote URL for the repository that you would like to monitor.

### `--dev`

Include development-only dependencies. Applicable only for some package managers, for example, `devDependencies` in npm or `:development` dependencies in Gemfile.

Default: scan only production dependencies.

### `--org=<ORG_ID>`

Specify the `<ORG_ID>` to run Snyk commands tied to a specific organization. The `<ORG_ID>` influences some features availability and private test limits.

If you have multiple organizations, you can set a default from the CLI using:

`$ snyk config set org=<ORG_ID>`

Set a default to ensure all newly tested projects are tested under your default organization. If you need to override the default, use the `--org=<ORG_ID>` option.

Default: `<ORG_ID>` that is the current preferred organization in your [Account settings](https://app.snyk.io/account)

For more information see the article [How to select the organization to use in the CLI](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360000920738-How-to-select-the-organization-to-use-in-the-CLI)

### `--file=<FILE>`

Specify a package file.

When testing locally or monitoring a project, you can specify the file that Snyk should inspect for package information. When the file is not specified, Snyk tries to detect the appropriate file for your project.

### `--package-manager=<PACKAGE_MANAGER_NAME>`

Specify the name of the package manager when the filename specified with the `--file=<FILE>` option is not standard. This allows Snyk to find the file.

Example: `$ snyk test --file=req.txt --package-manager=pip`

### `--unmanaged`

For C++ only, scan all files for known open source dependencies.

For options you can use with `--unmanaged` see [Options for scanning using `--unmanaged`](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/test#options-for-scanning-using-unmanaged)\`\`

For more information see [Snyk for C/C++](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-open-source/language-and-package-manager-support/snyk-for-c-c++)

### `--ignore-policy`

Ignore all set policies, the current policy in the `.snyk` file, org level ignores, and the project policy on snyk.io.

### `--trust-policies`

Apply and use ignore rules from the Snyk policies your dependencies; otherwise ignore rules in the dependencies are only shown as a suggestion.

### `--show-vulnerable-paths=<none|some|all>`

Display the dependency paths from the top level dependencies down to the vulnerable packages. Not supported with `--json-file-output`.

Default: `some` (a few example paths shown). `false` is an alias for `none`

Example: `--show-vulnerable-paths=none`

### `--project-name=<PROJECT_NAME>`

Specify a custom Snyk project name.

### `--target-reference=<TARGET_REFERENCE>`

Specify a reference which differentiates this project, for example, a branch name or version. Projects having the same reference can be grouped based on that reference. Only supported for Snyk Open Source.

For more information see [Separating projects by branch or version](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/secure-your-projects-in-the-long-term/grouping-projects-by-branch-or-version)

### `--policy-path=<PATH_TO_POLICY_FILE>`

Manually pass a path to a `.snyk` policy file.

### `--json`

Print results in JSON format.

Example: `$ snyk test --json`

### `--json-file-output=<OUTPUT_FILE_PATH>`

Save test output in JSON format directly to the specified file, regardless of whether or not you use the `--json` option.

This is useful if you want to display the human-readable test output using stdout and at the same time save the JSON format output to a file.

Example: `$ snyk test --json-file-output=vuln.json`

### `--sarif`

Return results in SARIF format.

### `--sarif-file-output=<OUTPUT_FILE_PATH>`

Save test output in SARIF format directly to the \<OUTPUT_FILE_PATH> file, regardless of whether or not you use the `--sarif` option.

This is especially useful if you want to display the human-readable test output using stdout and at the same time save the SARIF format output to a file.

### `--severity-threshold=<low|medium|high|critical>`

Report only vulnerabilities at the specified level or higher.

### `--fail-on=<all|upgradable|patchable>`

Fail only when there are vulnerabilities that can be fixed.

- `all`: fail when there is at least one vulnerability that can be either upgraded or patched.
- `upgradable`: fail when there is at least one vulnerability that can be upgraded.
- `patchable`: fail when there is at least one vulnerability that can be patched.

To fail on any vulnerability (the default behavior), do not use the `--fail-on` option. If vulnerabilities do not have a fix and this option is being used, tests pass.

## Option for Maven projects

For more information about Maven CLI options see [Snyk for Java and Kotlin](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-open-source/language-and-package-manager-support/snyk-for-java-gradle-maven)

### `--scan-all-unmanaged`

For Gradle "multi project" configurations, test a specific sub-project.

### `--all-sub-projects`

For "multi project" configurations, test all sub-projects.

### `--configuration-matching=<CONFIGURATION_REGEX>`

Resolve dependencies using only configuration(s) that match the specified Java regular expression

Example: `^releaseRuntimeClasspath$`

### `--configuration-attributes=<ATTRIBUTE>[,<ATTRIBUTE>]...`

Select certain values of configuration attributes to install dependencies and perform dependency resolution.

Example: `buildtype:release,usage:java-runtime`

### `--init-script=<FILE`

When monitoring a .NET project using NuGet `PackageReference` use the project name in `project.assets.json` if found.

### `--packages-folder`

Specify a custom path to the packages folder.

### `--project-name-prefix=<PREFIX_STRING>`

When monitoring a .NET project, use this option to add a custom prefix to the name of files inside a project along with any desired separators.

This is useful when you have multiple projects with the same name in other `.sln` files.

## Option for npm projects

### `--strict-out-of-sync=true|false`

Control testing out-of-sync lockfiles.

Default: true

## Options for Yarn projects

### `--strict-out-of-sync=true|false`

Control testing out-of-sync lockfiles.

Default: true

### `--yarn-workspaces`

Detect and scan Yarn workspaces. You can specify how many sub-directories to search using `--detection-depth` and exclude directories and files using `--exclude`. Alternatively scan Yarn workspaces with other projects using `--all-projects`

If you are using multiple Python versions, use this parameter to specify the correct Python command for execution.

Default: `python` Example: `--command=python3`

### `--skip-unresolved=true|false`

Allow skipping packages that are not found in the environment.

## Options for Go projects

Currently the following options are not supported:

`--fail-on=<all|upgradable|patchable>`

## Options for scanning using `--unmanaged`

`--org=<ORG_ID>`

`--json`

`--json-file-output=<OUTPUT_FILE_PATH>`

`--remote-repo-url=<URL>`

`--severity-threshold=<low|medium|high|critical>`

There are also special options as follows.

### `--target-dir`

Alternatively, run `snyk test --unmanaged`

### `--max-depth`

Specify the maximum level of archive extraction.

Usage: `--max-depth=1`&#x20;

Use 0 to disable archive extraction completely.

### `--print-dep-paths`

Display dependencies.

Use use this option to see what files contributed to each dependency identified.

To see how confident Snyk is about the identified dependency and its version, use the `--print-deps` or `--print-dep-paths` option.

For more information on uses of CLI options for C/C++ projects see [Snyk for C / C++](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-open-source/language-and-package-manager-support/snyk-for-c-c++)

## Options for build tools

### `-- [<CONTEXT-SPECIFIC_OPTIONS>]`
