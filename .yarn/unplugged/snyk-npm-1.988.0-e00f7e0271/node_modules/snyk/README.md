# What is Snyk CLI?

Snyk CLI brings the functionality of [Snyk](https://snyk.io) into your development workflow. It can be run locally or in your CI/CD pipeline to scan your projects for security issues.

## Supported languages and tools

Snyk supports many languages and tools, including Java, .NET, JavaScript, Python, Golang, PHP, C/C++, Ruby, Scala and more. See our [Language Support documentation](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020352437-Language-support-summary).

# Install Snyk CLI

Snyk CLI can be installed through multiple channels.

## Install with npm or Yarn

[Snyk CLI is available as an npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snyk). If you have Node.js installed locally, you can install it by running:

```bash
npm install snyk@latest -g
```

or if you are using Yarn:

```bash
yarn global add snyk
```

## More installation methods

<details>
  <summary>Standalone executables (macOS, Linux, Windows)</summary>

### Standalone executables

Use [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/snyk/snyk/releases) to download a standalone executable of Snyk CLI for your platform.

We also provide these standalone executables on our official CDN. See [the `release.json` file](https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/release.json) for the download links:

```text
https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/release.json

# Or for specific version or platform
https://static.snyk.io/cli/v1.666.0/release.json
https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-macos
```

For example, to download and run the latest Snyk CLI on macOS, you could run:

```bash
curl https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-macos -o snyk
chmod +x ./snyk
mv ./snyk /usr/local/bin/
```

You can also use these direct links to download the executables:

- macOS: https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-macos
- Windows: https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-win.exe
- Linux: https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-linux
- Linux (arm64): https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-linux-arm64
- Alpine: https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-alpine

Drawback of this method is, that you will have to manually keep the Snyk CLI up to date.

#### Verifying standalone binaries

You can verify both shasum of downloaded binaries and their GPG signatures.

Download location on `static.snyk.io` contains a file called `sha256sums.txt.asc`.
You can download it directly `https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/sha256sums.txt.asc` or for a specific version like `https://static.snyk.io/cli/v1.666.0/sha256sums.txt.asc`.

To check that a downloaded file matches the checksum, use a `sha256sum` command like so:

```bash
grep snyk-macos sha256sums.txt.asc | sha256sum -c -
```

If you want to verify Snyk CLI standalone binaries against [Snyk CLI GPG key](help/_about-this-project/snyk-code-signing-public.pgp), you will need to import it first:

```bash
# 68BFBCCEB7794E6FC06A2044A29C32E91F4B9569 is the key belonging to code-signing@snyk.io
# Copy of this public key is also in this repository /help/_about-this-project/snyk-code-signing-public.pgp
gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys 68BFBCCEB7794E6FC06A2044A29C32E91F4B9569
```

Then verify the file is signed with:

```bash
gpg --verify sha256sums.txt.asc
```

Command output should look like:

```plain
gpg: Signature made Mon Apr 25 16:55:01 2022 CEST
gpg:                using RSA key 68BFBCCEB7794E6FC06A2044A29C32E91F4B9569
gpg: Good signature from "Snyk Limited <code-signing@snyk.io>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 68BF BCCE B779 4E6F C06A  2044 A29C 32E9 1F4B 9569
```

  <summary>Snyk CLI in a Docker image</summary>

### Snyk CLI in a Docker image

Snyk CLI can also be run from a Docker image. Snyk offers multiple Docker tags under [`snyk/snyk`](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk). These images wrap the Snyk CLI and depending on the Tag come with a relevant tooling for different projects. [See the snyk/images on GitHub for more details and examples](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images).

## Install as a part of a Snyk CLI integration

Snyk also offers many integrations into developer tooling. These integrations will install and manage the Snyk CLI for you. For example:

- [Snyk Jenkins plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/snyk-security-scanner-plugin)
- [CircleCI Orb](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-orb)
- [Azure Pipelines Task](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-azure-pipelines-task)
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/snyk/actions)

# Getting started with Snyk CLI

Once you installed the Snyk CLI, you can verify it's working by running:

```bash
snyk --help
```

See the [full Snyk CLI help](./help/cli-commands).

## Authenticating Snyk CLI

Snyk CLI depends on [Snyk.io](https://snyk.io) APIs. Connect your Snyk CLI with [Snyk.io](https://snyk.io) by running:

```bash
snyk auth
```

## Setting up language support

Depending on your project's language, you might need to setup your language environment before using Snyk.

See our [Language Support documentation](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020352437-Language-support-summary).

## Scanning your project

If you are already in a folder with a supported project, start by running:

```bash
snyk test
```

Or scan a Docker image by its tag with [Snyk Container](https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/):

```bash
snyk container test ubuntu:18.04
```

Or a k8s file:

```bash
snyk iac test /path/to/kubernetes_file.yaml
```

## Monitoring your project

Snyk can also monitor your project periodically and alert you for new vulnerabilities. The `snyk monitor` is similar to `snyk test` and can be used to create a project on the Snyk website that will be continuously monitored for new vulnerabilities.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://snyk.io">
    <img src="help/monitor.svg" alt="Snyk CLI monitor projects" width="70%" />
  </a>

```
> snyk monitor
Monitoring /project (project-name)...

Notifications about newly disclosed issues related to these dependencies will be emailed to you.
```

### Add Snyk to your CI/CD

Snyk is really powerful when you are continuously scanning and monitoring your projects for vulnerabilities.

Use one of [our integrations](#install-as-a-part-of-a-snyk-cli-integration) to stay secure.

You can authorize Snyk CLI in your CI/CD programatically:

```bash
# Using a SNYK_TOKEN envvar (preferred)
SNYK_TOKEN=<SNYK_API_TOKEN> snyk test

# Or using a Snyk auth command
snyk auth <SNYK_API_TOKEN>
snyk test
```

## More flags and options to try

Here are some flags that you might find useful:

- `--severity-threshold=low|medium|high|critical`

  Only report vulnerabilities of provided level or higher.

- `--json`

  Prints results in JSON format.

- `--all-projects`

  Auto-detect all projects in working directory

[See all the available commands and options](./help/cli-commands) by running `--help`:

```bash
snyk --help
# or get help for a specific command like
snyk iac --help
snyk code --help
```
